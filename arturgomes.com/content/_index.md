# Hey, I'm Artur

I'm a Backend Developer at [Counterpart](https://yourcounterpart.com) with over 10 years of experience building scalable systems with Python.

## What I Do

By day, I architect and build APIs using Django and Django REST Framework. I'm passionate about clean code, robust architectures, and automation.

By night, I tinker with my homelab - self-hosting services, experimenting with Docker containers, and exploring the world of infrastructure as code.

## Recent Posts
